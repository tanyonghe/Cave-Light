# Cave Light

Cave Light is a 2D side scrolling, single-player action-puzzle platformer. 

## Game Overview

The player controls a caved-in miner as he makes his escape and ascent out of the series of caverns. 
His only tool is a mining laser that can conduct the energy of the elemental crystals in the mine to take on various properties, 
and overcome obstacles and enemies. The game ends when the player successfully escapes, or meet his end at the various hazards 
and horrors of the mines. This game is appealing to players who like games that mix problem solving and action platforming.

### Objectives/Goals

The objective of Cave Light is to escape a cave complex by clearing levels by overcoming impassable terrain and defeating or evading monsters.

### Difficulties

The cave complex is filled with numerous obstacles such as deadly pits, rivers and stalagmites. 
Monsters that roam the caves also threaten the miner. Players only have a single tool/weapon (their laser) available to them, 
and must learn its interactions with various environmental entities. Hence, each level is a puzzle for them to solve.

### Game Over

The game ends when the player either successfully escapes the cave or loses all their lives.
